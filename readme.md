# GodotFox

The idea of this little prototype here is to checkout how to project lines and planes onto the screen without a grapics card.  
The reason are video games like Starfox (SNES), Elite, Frontier or Viper from the Amiga. I like the style of the vector graphics.  
But, also the calculations to be done without even a FPU is interesting to me.  
So, I checked how to accomplish this. I used Godot 4.2.1 for testing.
